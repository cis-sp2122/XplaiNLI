# About

This is XplaiNLI, an interactive, user-friendly, visualization interface for NLI. It uses the principles of the Hy-NLI system to compute inference with a deep learning (DL), 
a symbolic and a hybrid approach. Instead of targetting performance as Hy-NLI does, XplaiNLI focuses on explainability. Thus, additionally to the inference labels,
it offers sketches of explanations for the features that lead to the decision of each component. The interface also allows interaction with the user. The user can define their 
own heuristics as potential explanations for the decisions and also annotate the pair with the correct label. Find more details in our paper:

# Installation 
If you are only interested in the backend of the system, check out our Hy-NLI repo: https://github.com/kkalouli/Hy-NLI


If you are interested in the demo system, read further:

The demo runs as part of the symbolic component of the system, GKR4NLI, as an HtmlServlet. A pair is input on the frontend and is then forwarded for processing....
